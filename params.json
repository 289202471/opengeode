{"name":"Opengeode","tagline":"OpenGEODE - A tiny free SDL [Specification and Description Language] editor","body":"OpenGEODE\r\n=========\r\n\r\nOpenGEODE is a tiny open-source SDL editor that is developed for\r\nthe purpose of providing an easy to use and free state machine editor and\r\nAda code generator to the TASTE toolchain from the European Space Agency,\r\nrunning in combination with ESA's ASN.1 \"Space Certifiable\" ASN.1 compiler.\r\n\r\nSDL is the Specification and Description Language (Z100 standard from ITU-T).\r\n\r\nThis is NOT related to the graphical Simple DirectMedia Layer libraries!\r\n\r\nVisit http://sdl-forum.org for more information about SDL.\r\nVisit http://www.pragmadev.com to get a full-featured commercial SDL tool and support\r\n\r\n\r\n![alt tag](icons/opengeode-screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Graphical editor of SDL processes and procedures.\r\n- SDL2010 features: FOR loops in task symbols, hierarchical states \r\n- Works on pure PR+CIF files (textual SDL notation) - no fancy proprietary save format\r\n- Supports ASN.1 data types, including the Value notation - check this page to know more about our ASN.1 compiler and tools \r\n- Generates Ada code with ASN.1 types using TASTE ASN.1 \"space-certified\" (SPARK) compiler \r\n- Extensive syntax and semantic checks \r\n- Automatic conversion to Statechart diagrams \r\n- Save the complete or parts of the model to PNG/SVG/PDF files\r\n- Hyperlinks (link a symbol content to any external document or web page) \r\n- Zoom in, zoom-out \r\n- Context-dependent text auto-completion \r\n- Syntax highlighting \r\n- Undo/Redo, Copy-Paste \r\n- (Limited) VIM mode - You can use :wq or :%s,search,replace,g, and /search pattern\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nPre-requisites\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThere are three major dependencies for OpenGEODE:\r\n\r\n- Pyside (the Qt bindings for Python)\r\n- Python ANTLR Runtime\r\n- PyGraphviz (Linux only - not available on Windows)\r\n\r\nIf you use pip to install OpenGEODE, these dependencies should be installed\r\nautomatically. However, note that installing PySide from pip requires some\r\nwork and is not straightforward.\r\n\r\nIf you are using a Linux Debian-based distribution (including Ubuntu),\r\nI would recommended to install PySide using your package manager:\r\nYou should also install pygraphviz using the same method, for convenience.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo apt-get install python-pyside pyside-tools python-pygraphviz pip\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Python 2.7 ANTLR 3.1.3 runtime is not part of Debian packages. Install\r\nit with pip (or download and install manually the package):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip install antlr_python_runtime singledispatch\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Windows:\r\n\r\nYou need to download and install Python, Pyside, and pip (binaries are\r\navailable on respective websites)\r\n\r\nOn FreeBSD:\r\n\r\nPySide is available through the ports.\r\nYou can also use easy_install to install it.\r\nUse pip to install the ANTLR runtime (see above)\r\n\r\nAutomatic installation (recommended)\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo install the application on your machine:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip install --upgrade opengeode\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is sufficient to get opengeode running\r\n\r\nIn addition OpenGEODE is capable of generating code for embedded, real-\r\ntime systems in the Ada programming language, with compact and efficient\r\ndata manipulation and binary encoding using the ASN.1 notation.\r\n\r\nTo get the full benefits of SDL and OpenGEODE, consider installing\r\nTASTE, that is a complete development environment dedicated to\r\nreal-time, embedded systems from the European Space Agency.\r\n\r\nTASTE also allows the transparent integration and communication between\r\nmodels developed by commercial tools such as Matlab-Simulink and \r\nReal-Time Developer Studio.\r\n\r\nInstallation from source\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can get the source from the TASTE repositories or from GitHub\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ svn co https://tecsw.estec.esa.int/svn/taste/trunk/misc/opengeode opengeode\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/maxime-esa/opengeode.git opengeode\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThen enter the opengeode directory and as root, type:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nInformation and contact\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nOpenGEODE is part of the TASTE project.\r\n\r\nFind more information and download at http://taste.tuxfamily.org\r\n\r\nOpenGEODE is developed and maintained by Maxime Perrotin\r\nmaxime (dot) perrotin (at) esa (dot) int\r\n\r\nThe background pattern was downloaded from www.subtlepatterns.com\r\n\r\nThe ASN.1 compiler (ASN1Scc) that OpenGEODE is based on was\r\ndeveloped by George Mamais and Thanassis Tsiodras for the European\r\nSpace Agency.
